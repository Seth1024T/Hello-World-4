# https://github.com/Seth1024T/Hello-World-3.
# Changes made include the use of modules, and changing the constant Decoration1 to the function decoration_funct1, and
# making generalized functions to hide information, and keep code sections nice and short, so that it's easy to read,
# understand, and maintain.
