# Hello-World-4
A simple program that says hello world, but with some advance features. In Hello World 4 we
make the module more general, and use functions to hide information to keep programs, and
the parts short, easy to read, understandable, and easier to maintain. It's possible that
the module is now more useful to any future programs we might want to make.

Hello World and modules

You might wonder: what happens when you create hundreds of programs, how do you handle that?
That is not an easy thing to answer, as you may suspect, maintaining, and making use of
old programs can require quite a bit of administration skills. Documenting your programs can
help you understand what the programs do months, or years later.

Making your programs into short units can also help people that don't know about your program,
understand what a part of the program does. Such short units are often procedures, functions,
or objects in OOP (Object Orientated Programming). Small amounts of code units may also help you
understand what parts of your program do.

In the first Hello World program we made some early use of functions. Here we will investigate
how we can put those functions into modules, and eventually into seperate files (that contain
modules).

Hello World 4 further adds to, and modifies Hello World 3: https://github.com/Seth1024T/Hello-World-3

In Hello World 4 we hide information in functions, and put those functions into other functions. 
This may seem silly at first, but it shows some more advance concepts in how to make libaries,
and how to make useful easy to read code that can be used by many different programs. It's easy
to make programs of several hundreds of lines, but you should try and avoid this, as such
programs can be hard to read, understand, and maintain.

The advantage of having a seperate file that contains modules, is that you can connect those
seperate files to a new prgram you are making, and speed up the time it takes to make a program.

This also allows you to make large libraries of functions, procedures, and objects. These
libraries are somtimes in demand by other people like yourself that want to save time.

However people may find it hard to make use of your libaries of programs in some cases, as they
may not be well documented, and handy examples might not be available. It can take a lot of effort
to make a library of functions, procedures, and classes suitable for use by other people.

If you don't put a lot of effort into your libraries of code, you might even find them difficult to
use later on.

Another thing about libraries of code, is that making somthing that is short and generalized for many
uses is a skill in itself, and this step can make the code so abstract, that it may take a little time
to figure out how to use it for a particular project.

Okay, so check out the program for more details on how to use modules, and to put them into seperate
files.
